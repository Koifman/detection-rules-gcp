# Contribution Guide for Google Security Operations Community Rules

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This document
contains guidelines for contributors including a style guide for writing YARA-L

Members of our community may submit YARA-L rule contributions under the
[`rules/community`](https://github.com/chronicle/detection-rules/tree/main/rules/community) directory.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/
to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project maintainers, require review.
We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for more information on using pull requests.

We try and acknowledge all issues and pull requests within a few working days.

We're happy to collaborate with contributors to make modifications
and help get their contributions accepted. However, there may be instances where
we're unable to accept your contribution. For example, if a rule contains
invalid syntax or its detection use case is too broad or niche to apply to the
environments of other Google SecOps customers.

## Community Guidelines

## Style Guide for YARA-L Detection Rules

Rules in this repository follow our [style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md). For
